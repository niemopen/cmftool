# NIEM Message Translation (NIEMTran) tool, version 1.0

This subproject is part of the CMFTool project repository.  It contains the NIEMOpen message translation tool (NIEMTran).

At present, NIEM supports two message serializations:  XML and JSON.  A message in one can be transformed to the equivalent message in the other.  NIEMTran uses the information in the message model to drive the transformation.  It is a multi-level command-line tool; at present, one subcommand is implemeted:

*  [*x2j*](#convert-niem-xml-to-json) -- convert a NIEM message from XML to JSON

### Convert NIEM XML to JSON

*Usage:* **niemtran x2j** *[options]* *model.cmf message.xml ...*

Converts each *message.xml* file to the equivalent *message.json*.

| Options: | |
| -- | -- |
| `-c, --context` |  generate complete @context in the result |
| `--curi URI`   |  include "@context:" URI pair in the result |
| `-f, --force` |  overwrite existing .json files |

## Getting started

1. You must have a Java runtime environment.  JRE21 or later will work.  JRE17 might work.  
   - Try `java â€“-version` from the command line.  If that works, you should be OK
   - Otherwise make sure your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to your JRE

2. Unpack the executable distribution from the Assets tab on the [Release page](https://github.com/niemopen/cmftool/releases)
   - The *niemtran* program by itself is in *niemtran-1.0.zip*
   - All three programs from this repo are in *cmftool-allApps-1.0.zip*

3. Put the *bin* directory into your PATH, create a shell alias, etc.
4. Try `cmftool help` from the command line

## Examples

The [*Crash Driver Report*](https://github.com/iamdrscott/CrashDriver) message specification is designed to test and describe the features of the NIEM technical architecture.  Try `make -n all` to see some of the things you can to with *niemtran*.

## Building

This project was built with NetBeans 24, Gradle 8.12, and Oracle JDK 21.
Try `./gradlew build`
